# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
Credit Card Fraud Detection: Rare fraud transactions, imbalanced data may cause overfitting &amp; bias towards majority class, an anomaly detection problem.


• Implemented a scalable credit card fraud detection system using machine learning algorithm, leveraging advanced data analytics techniques such as anomaly detection, to identify patterns involving smaller amounts below 2500.
• Achieved 99% accuracy through in-depth data analysis, feature engineering on a real-world credit card transaction dataset.
